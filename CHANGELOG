To version libstb-1.1:
*	removed all references to GSL NEGINF and infinite/NAN handling
        in library functions longer have GSL dependencies
*       made all the library allocation functions return 1 on error
*       removed all yap_*() dependencies in library functions
*	added digamma.h to isolate use of GSL special functions
*       added rng.h to isolate use of GSL random number routines in lib/
*       fixed alloc bug in stable.c only seen when N==M
*       added slice sampling
*       restructured directory with test/ and lib/
*       added the alpha.pdf documentation
*       added sampleb() and samplea() functions to library

To version libstb-1.2:
*	added the lib/sxtable versions, which were elsewhere
*       bug fix in sampleb() when a>0
*       made generic INT types for stats passed to samplers

To version libstb-1.3:
*	modified ttable.h so it now creates an object, no more static tables

To version libstb-1.4
*       MAJOR upgrade!!!
*       removed ttable.* suite and merged into new stable.*
*       now expands uniformly in both dimensions N and T on call;
*       flags for double/float, verbose, S and/or U+V tables;
*       demoted "check.c" and replaced with the friendlier "demo.c"
*       added sympoly.h for elementary symmetric polynomials, which
*          become important in various more convoluted PYP models

To version libstb-1.5
*       made K and bpar dependent on [i] 
*          -> WARNING, thus the interface has changed!
*       fixed bug in samplea() when using getval()
*       SVN version 58

To version libstb-1.6
*       some memory deallocation in arms.c
*       added new "tag" to tables to help in debugging
*       added new S_UV() routine, very handy for indicator sampling
*       SVN version 66
